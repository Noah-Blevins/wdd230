            Amazon embodies Hick's law rather well. Being a rather large online storefront, there are thousands of items for sale,
            which means that navigating the user to an item in order to buy one requires careful application of this law.
            The options presented take up a lot of room on the page, but each option leads to a smaller subcategory of even more
            options. This ensures that each visitor to the website can explore quickly, while also seeing enough choices to stay a while
            and hopefully make a purchase.
